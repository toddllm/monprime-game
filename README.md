# MonPrime - AR Battle & Collection Game

An innovative AR game where players physically interact with creatures called "Mons" in a high-stakes world created by the mysterious Zeldina.

## 🎮 Game Concept

MonPrime takes the AR creature collection genre to the next level with:
- **Physical Combat**: Actually punch Mons with gesture controls
- **High Stakes**: Get defeated and you're kicked from the game
- **Golden Books**: Unique capture system with storage limitations
- **Dynamic Curses**: 20-second gameplay modifiers that keep you on edge
- **1 Million Mons**: Procedurally generated creatures to discover

├── README.md                    # This file
├── GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md      # Complete game design
├── TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md    # System architecture
├── DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md       # 12-month development plan
└── PROTOTYPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md  # Code samples to get started
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Game Designers
Start with `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` to understand:
- Core gameplay loop
- Unique mechanics (Golden Books, Curses, Physical Combat)
- Monetization strategy
- Risk mitigation

### For Developers
1. Review `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
2. Follow `PROTOTYPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` to build first playable
3. Check `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` for sprint planning

### For Producers/PMs
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` has timeline and resource requirements
- Budget estimates: $2.5-3.5M development + $0.5-1M marketing
- Team size: 20-25 people
- Timeline: 12 months to launch

## 🎯 Key Features

### Combat System
- Gesture-based punching mechanics
- Physics-based Mon reactions (they get flung!)
- Risk/reward: Some Mons can vaporize players
- Mandatory battles - fight or be eliminated

### Golden Book System
- Replace Pokéballs with magical books
- Limited storage creates strategic decisions
- Master Book (Zeldina's) can capture other books
- Some Mons too large to fit!

### Curse Cycles
- Every 20 seconds a new curse activates
- Examples: Double spawns, Invisible Mons, Reversed controls
- Keeps gameplay fresh and unpredictable

### Environmental Awareness
- Real-time weather affects spawns
- Day/night cycle changes available Mons
- Location-based Mon types
- AR integration with real world

## 🔗 Narrative Connection

The game is based on the zeldina-story.txt narrative analysis:
- **Wordvile**: The mysterious arcade game that started it all
- **Main Characters**: Marco (tech genius), Lily (strategist), Zack (athlete), Ava (artist)
- **Zeldina**: The creator-void entity behind everything
- **MonPrime**: The digital world bleeding into reality

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Unity 2023 LTS
- **AR**: ARCore (Android) + ARKit (iOS)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Go microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + MongoDB + Redis
- **Networking**: Mirror or Photon Fusion
- **Cloud**: AWS/GCP with Kubernetes

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Launch Goals
- Day 1: 100K downloads
- Month 1: 2M downloads
- Retention: 40% Day 7, 25% Day 30
- Revenue: $1M first month

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS on flagship devices
- < 10 second load time
- < 0.5% crash rate
- 2+ hour battery life

## 🎨 From Story to Game

The narrative analysis reveals key elements we're incorporating:

1. **The Arcade Origin**: Tutorial takes place in Hillcrest Arcade
2. **Character Classes**: Based on the four protagonists' skills
3. **Wordvile Mystery**: Uncover why the game appeared
4. **Zeldina's Purpose**: End-game content exploring her motivations
5. **Real/Digital Merge**: Story missions about worlds colliding

## 🚦 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Set up Unity project with AR Foundation
2. Create basic Mon prototype with physics
3. Implement touch-based combat
4. Test AR plane detection

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. 5 playable Mons with unique abilities
2. Golden Book capture system
3. Basic curse cycle implementation
4. Local save system

### Medium Term (Month 3)
1. 100 Mons with procedural variations
2. Multiplayer infrastructure
3. Environmental spawn system
4. Beta testing program

## 🤝 Contributing

This is currently in the planning phase. We're looking for:
- Unity developers with AR experience
- Backend engineers (Node.js/Go)
- 3D artists for Mon designs
- Game designers for balancing
- QA testers with AR devices

## 📜 License

TBD - Likely proprietary with some open-source components

## 🔮 Vision

MonPrime aims to be more than just "Pokémon Go with punching." We're creating a high-stakes AR experience where every encounter matters, the world constantly changes through curses, and the mystery of Zeldina keeps players coming back.

The game respects player intelligence with deep mechanics while remaining accessible through intuitive AR interactions. By grounding the fantastical elements in the relatable story of four friends discovering something extraordinary, we create an emotional connection beyond just collecting creatures.

Ready to enter MonPrime? The Mons are waiting... and they punch back.
