# Implementation Review Plan

This document summarizes the work required across the MonPrime repositories for the initial review phase tracked in [Issue #1](https://github.com/toddllm/monprime-game/issues/1).

## Goals
- Research best practices for each platform
- Create or expand architecture documents in each repository
- Update task lists with prioritized subtasks
- Document key technical decisions

## Repository Tasks

### monprime-web
- Investigate latest WebXR and Three.js techniques
- Document component hierarchy and data flow in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Provide browser support matrix and performance benchmarks in `README.md`
- Expand `TASKS.md` with detailed subtasks and priority notes

### monprime-unity
- Review Unity 2023 LTS AR Foundation features
- Outline folder structure and assembly definitions in `UNITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Create `PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md` with target metrics and profiling tips
- Update `TASKS.md` to reflect dependency order and testing requirements

### monprime-mobile
- Compare React Native AR libraries (ViroReact, Vision Camera, etc.)
- Propose component and state management strategy in `MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Document platform-specific considerations in `PLATFORM_GUIDE.md`
- Add subtasks and benchmarks to `TASKS.md`

## Coordination
- Shared interfaces and backend contracts will live in future `monprime-shared` and `monprime-backend` repositories.
- Design changes and high-level decisions should be recorded in this repository.
- Agents should comment on Issue #1 when claiming a repository and link their PRs.
